Production of Media Content

STORIES
- there is a long history of storytelling
- this is now called: CONTENT 

3 legs of Media
Content
Distribution
Devices

Why has one particular pdouction center (hollywood) such a global superiority?

What did Hollywood do when TV emerged?
- First they ignored
- Told directors/actors/screen-writers it's either TV or Film,
	basically boycot
- Sold TV their old films 
- Then they went to 3D movies / spectacles

When VCR emerged
- It would have been a way to go to customers straight instead of going through theater
	- They were afraid of piracy 

ex. Ronal Reagan did a TV show then never had a hollywood film

Hollywood never missed an oppportunity to miss an opportunity.
Always fought against technological advancement
STILL they have been dominant

wherever content is going, it would be where hollywood was first.

Case Discussion: Canal Plus:
	- In search of the Hollywood Formula

Canal Plus:
- French HBO
- owned by Vivendi
- Monopoly in France


President Mitterand gives monopoly license for Pay-TV to his trusted aide Andre Rousselet
-> harms:
	1. Film producers who aren't working with Rousselet
	2. Consumers had to pay more
		$58 for CanalPlus vs $11 for HBO

Vivendi
- conglomerate of : music, games, telecommunication, film (Universal Studios)
- then overexpanded 

Hollywood "The Dream FACTORY"
- TV content supply in NYC total video program hurs per week in NY 80,000 in 2015
- not including online and home video 


Elements of Production:
- selection of project
- product design and testing
- approval of product
- funding of process
- production process planning
- procurement of inputs
- deployment of work force
- creation of equipment
- testing and fine-tuning



Production is generally don in either of two basic ways:
- Special Order "job shop"
- Industrial Mas Production "flow shop"

What is the ancestor of film?
- Theater (Europe)
- Vaudeville/Burlesque (US)
^ probem with these are that they don't scale

			Fixed Cost (Content)		Marginal Cost (Distribution)
Theater          $25 							$0.56c
Film 			$10,000 						$0.005c

Film is inherently more risky 



Photography - Daguerrotype - Fixed image on glass
George Eastman (Kodak) - Flexible Celluloid Film

First Real Film - 1895, by Lumiere brothers
	- no content, no plot, no character
	- but the technology was so great! 

Then new content emerged
Then very rapidly 

For several centuries, culture flowed largely in one direction:
	out of Europe, and to the colonies and the rest of the world: books, theater, music

Fear of US as content hub

Chaiers 
Du Cinema 
- most influential journal of film criticism
- "the vogue for tasting films"



What might be the reason for Hollywood's Success as a Content Production Center?
1. Market Size
	- Language Market: 			Total Market Size (tril)
		English - 1500					18.9
		Mandarin - 1200					3.1
		Spanish - 450					2.0
		Bengali - 200					0.4
		Hindi - 350						1.2
		Arabic - 400					1.7

	- But So Whaaaat?
		- Belgian Chocoalte, Swiss watches
		- If English is the important part and the content stuff, then make a film in English! 

	- Most successful foreign language film in US
		- PASSION OF CHRIST

	- Spaghetti Westerns
		- cowboy movies
		- Italian
		- Clent Eastwood

	- films that deal with race issues don't do well in europe, but 

2. Vertical Integration Production/Distribution
	- Best strategy is for each section to optimize their own
		ex. Disney makes a show and Paramount will buy for 2M and ABC for 1M, go to Paramount
	- But then, what's the point of having a vertical integration?
		- You could have control over the release sequence! 

3. Big Stars and Big Budgets
	- Are "stars" essential to hollywood company success?
		ex. Di Caprio
			Titanic - 900M
			Iron Mask - 30M
			Celebrity - 3M
	- But stars make the production possible
	- Stars increase box office revenue, but don't increase profit
		but they also come with high cost (lighting, other actors)

Three major factors for superior production
1. Organizational Structure
	- Universal Studio Lots
	- Actors get salaries
	- huge overhead
	- this worked, until TV happened. Before TV people used to go to theater 3-10 times a week
	- For those who bought TV, they were pretty expensive (current day's $5000) so they just stayed and watched to make money out of it 
2. Risk Reduction
	- Selection of lower risk proejcts
		- ex. sequels / prequels
		- book remake 
	- Step-Wise Investment Commitment (Option Contracts)
	- insurance
		ex. Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge 
	- Content Portfolios and Diversification
		- you can lower the risk of the portfolio by having a mix of things that correlate to each other
3. Product Development 
	- Concept Creation
		Audience distribution and content pitch 
	- Selection
	- Development
	- Production planning
	- procurement of inputs
	- quality testing 


In Hollywood, the Key Coordinators are:
1) Test Poll
2) Independent Producers and Talent Agents
3) Producers / title is difficult to define


Clustering is Prevalent in Media and Information Sector
- Hallywood, Silicon Valley, Bollywood, Madison Avenue, Sixth Avenue, etc 

Elements of Pop Culture
 - brisk pacing
 - sexual tension
 - graphic violence
 - special effects
 - intrigue
 - modd music
 - a novel approach to an old fable
 - happy ending or wow finish


Fairytale like
- weak youth become strong character with purpose
- eccentric characters good for toy or game licensing
- chaste relationship for different sexes

Product Selection
- Only 1 in 1000 is chosen
- TV Shows: 1 out of 5000

Statistical Tools for Project Selection?
- none so far

Tools of Operations Management:
A. Activities Budgeting and Cost Control
B. Capacity Planning
	- Linear Programming
C. Input Optimization
	- Production and Cost Function
		ex. Cobb-Douglas Production function
			Q = AK^a L ^b
			Make the exponential equation into a linear one that can be readily estimated statistically
			lnQ = lnA + alnK + blnL
D. Scheduling
	- Chart Grantt
E. Priority Assignment
	- CPM : Critical Path Method
F. Inventory Control

CanalPlus
1st Strategy: Buy Hollywood Studios and French Studios
2nd Strategy: Seeking Governmental Support (Funding, Protectionism, Monopoly Distribution)
3rd Strategy: Vertical Integration of Production and Distribution 
5th Strategy: Dropping French 
6th Strategy: Content Mainstreaming and Globalization (Less french oriented content, more global)
7th Strategy: Technology (nah)
8th Strategy: Stars (they've been doing it)
10th Strategy: Financing

Conclusion: Canal Plus is successful by becoming a copy of hollywood
	- not france vs us but more of a model thing                        
Success of pushing an agenda of national culture in a global world of consumer-driven eneratinment
